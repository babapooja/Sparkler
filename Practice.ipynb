    "docs = ['Patients with deaths from COVID-19 often have co-morbid cardiovascular disease. Real-time cardiovascular disease monitoring based on wearable medical devices may effectively reduce COVID-19 mortality rates. However, due to technical limitations, there are three main issues. First, the traditional wireless communication technology for wearable medical devices is difficult to satisfy the real-time requirements fully. Second, current monitoring platforms lack efficient streaming data processing mechanisms to cope with the large amount of cardiovascular data generated in real time. Third, the diagnosis of the monitoring platform is usually manual, which is challenging to ensure that enough doctors online to provide a timely, efficient, and accurate diagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 5G-enabled real-time cardiovascular monitoring system for COVID-19 patients using deep learning. Firstly, we employ 5G to send and receive data from wearable medical devices. Secondly, Flink streaming data processing framework is applied to access electrocardiogram data. Finally, we use convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks model to obtain automatically predict the COVID-19 patient’s cardiovascular health. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposal can well solve the above issues and improve the prediction accuracy of cardiovascular disease to 99.29%.', 'Myocardial inflammation in COVID-19 has been documented. Its pathogenesis is not fully elucidated, but the two main theories foresee a direct role of ACE2 receptor and a hyperimmune response, which may also lead to isolated presentation of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis. The frequency and prognostic impact of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis is unknown. This review aims to summarise current evidence on this topic. We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (1/12/19–30/09/20). We also searched clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished studies testing therapies with potential implication for COVID-19-mediated cardiovascular complication. Eligible studies had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and a clinical and/or histological diagnosis of myocarditis by ESC or WHO/ISFC criteria. Reports of 38 cases were included (26 male patients, 24 aged <\\u200950\\xa0years). The first histologically proven case was a virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis; however, biopsy evidence of myocarditis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 cardiotropism has been recently demonstrated. Histological data was found in 12 cases (8 EMB and 4 autopsies) and CMR was the main imaging modality to confirm a diagnosis of myocarditis (25 patients). There was a substantial variability in biventricular systolic function during the acute episode and in therapeutic regimen used. Five patients died in hospital. Cause-effect relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and myocarditis is difficult to demonstrate. However, current evidence demonstrates myocardial inflammation with or without direct cardiomyocyte damage, suggesting different pathophysiology mechanisms responsible of COVID-mediated myocarditis. Established clinical approaches should be pursued until future evidence support different actions. Large multicentre registries are advisable to elucidate further.', 'Heart failure is a common disease state that can be encountered at different stages in the course of a COVID-19 patient presentation. New or existing heart failure in the setting of COVID-19 can present a set of unique challenges that can complicate presentation, management, and prognosis. A careful understanding of the hemodynamic and diagnostic implications is essential for appropriate triage and management of these patients. Abnormal cardiac biomarkers are common in COVID-19 and can stem from a variety of mechanisms that involve the viral entry itself through the ACE2 receptors, direct cardiac injury, increased thrombotic activity, stress cardiomyopathy, and among others. The cytokine storm observed in this pandemic can be a culprit in many of the observed mechanisms and presentations. A correct understanding of the two-way interaction between heart failure medications and the infection as well as the proposed COVID-19 medications and heart failure can result in optimal management. Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure should not be interrupted for theoretical concerns but rather based on tolerance and clinical presentation. Initiating specific cardiac or heart failure medications to prevent the infection or mitigate the disease is also not an evidence-based practice at this time. Heart failure patients on advanced therapies including those with heart transplantation will particularly benefit from involving the advanced heart failure team members in the overall management if they contract the virus.', 'The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) with severity (invasive mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit admission or O2 saturation\\u2009<\\u200990%) and mortality of COVID-19 cases. Systematic review of the PubMed, Cochrane Library and SciELO databases was performed to identify relevant articles published from December 2019 to 6th May 2020. Forty articles were included involving 18.012 COVID-19 patients. The random-effect meta-analysis showed that diabetes mellitus and hypertension were moderately associated respectively with severity and mortality for COVID-19: Diabetes [OR 2.35 95% CI 1.80–3.06 and OR 2.50 95% CI 1.74–3.59] Hypertension: [OR 2.98 95% CI 2.37–3.75 and OR 2.88 (2.22–3.74)]. Cardiovascular disease was strongly associated with both severity and mortality, respectively [OR 4.02 (2.76–5.86) and OR 6.34 (3.71–10.84)]. On the contrary, the use of ACEI/ARB, was not associate with severity of COVID-19. In conclusion, diabetes, hypertension and especially cardiovascular disease, are important risk factors for severity and mortality in COVID-19 infected people and are targets that must be intensively addressed in the management of this infection.', 'Over the month of April, Spain has become the European country with more confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, after surpassing Italy on April 2nd. The community of Castile and León in Spain is one of the most affected by COVID-19 infection and the province of León has a total of 3711 cases and 425 deaths so far. Rheumatic patients should be given special attention regarding COVID-19 infection due to their immunocompromised state resulting from their underlying immune conditions and use of targeted immune-modulating therapies. Studying epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases infected with SARS-CoV2 is pivotal to clarify determinants of COVID-19 disease severity in patients with underlying rheumatic disease. To describe epidemiological characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases hospitalized with COVID-19 and determine risk factors associated with mortality in a third level Hospital setting in León, Spain. We performed a prospective observational study, from 1st March 2020 until the 1st of June including adults with rheumatic diseases hospitalized with COVID-19 and performed a univariate and multivariate logistic regression model to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of mortality. Age, sex, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis and treatment, disease activity prior to infection, radiographic and laboratorial results at arrival were analysed. During the study period, 3711 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital, of whom 38 (10%) had a rheumatic or musculoskeletal disease. Fifty-three percent were women, with a mean age at hospital admission of 75.3 (IQR 68–83) years. The median length of stay was 11\\xa0days. A total of 10 patients died (26%) during their hospital admission. Patients who died from COVID-19 were older (median age 78.4 IQR 74.5–83.5) than those who survived COVID-19 (median age 75.1 IQR 69.3–75.8) and more likely to have arterial hypertension (9 [90%] vs 14 [50%] patients; OR 9 (95% CI 1.0–80.8), p 0.049), dyslipidaemia (9 (90%) vs 12 (43%); OR 12 (95% CI 1.33–108), p 0.03), diabetes ((9 (90%) vs 6 (28%) patients; OR 33, p 0.002), interstitial lung disease (6 (60%) vs 6 (21%); OR 5.5 (95% CI 1.16–26), p 0.03), cardiovascular disease (8 (80%) vs 11 (39%); OR 6.18 (95% IC 1.10–34.7, p 0.04) and a moderate/high index of rheumatic disease activity (7 (25%) vs 6(60%); OR 41.4 (4.23–405.23), p 0.04). In univariate analyses, we also found that patients who died from COVID-19 had higher hyperinflammation markers than patients who survived: C-reactive protein (181 (IQR 120–220) vs 107.4 (IQR 30–150; p 0.05); lactate dehydrogenase (641.8 (IQR 465.75–853.5) vs 361 (IQR 250–450), p 0.03); serum ferritin (1026 (IQR 228.3–1536.3) vs 861.3 (IQR 389–1490.5), p 0.04); D-dimer (12,019.8 (IQR 843.5–25,790.5) vs 1544.3 (IQR 619–1622), p 0.04). No differences in sex, radiological abnormalities, rheumatological disease, background therapy or symptoms before admission between deceased patients and survivors were found. In the multivariate analysis, the following risk factors were associated with mortality: rheumatic disease activity (p\\xa0=\\u20090.003), dyslipidaemia (p\\xa0=\\u20090.01), cardiovascular disease (p\\xa0=\\u20090.02) and interstitial lung disease (p\\xa0=\\u20090.02). Age, hypertension and diabetes were significant predictors in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. Rheumatic disease activity was significantly associated with fever (p\\xa0=\\u20090.05), interstitial lung disease (p\\xa0=\\u20090.03), cardiovascular disease (p\\xa0=\\u20090.03) and dyslipidaemia (p\\xa0=\\u20090.01). Our results suggest that comorbidities, rheumatic disease activity and laboratorial abnormalities such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum ferritin elevation significantly associated with mortality whereas previous use of rheumatic medication did not. Inflammation is closely related to severity of COVID-19.', 'The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in December 2019 form Wuhan, China leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While the common cold symptoms are observed in mild cases, COVID-19 is accompanied by multiorgan failure in severe patients. The involvement of different organs in severe patients results in lengthening the hospitalization duration and increasing the mortality rate. In this review, we aimed to investigate the involvement of different organs in COVID-19 patients, particularly in severe cases. Also, we tried to define the potential underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 induced multiorgan failure. The multi-organ dysfunction is characterized by acute lung failure, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, and as well as a wide spectrum of hematological abnormalities and neurological disorders. The most important mechanisms are related to the direct and indirect pathogenic features of SARS-CoV2. Although the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor of SARS-CoV2 in the lung, heart, kidney, testis, liver, lymphocytes, and nervous system was confirmed, there are controversial findings to about the observation of SARS-CoV2 RNA in these organs. Moreover, the organ failure may be induced by the cytokine storm, a result of increased levels of inflammatory mediators, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the organs. Therefore, further investigations are needed to detect the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis. Since the involvement of several organs in COVID-19 patients is important for clinicians, increasing their knowledge may help to improve the outcomes and decrease the rate of mortality and morbidity.', 'We summarize the cardiovascular risks associated with Covid-19 pandemic, discussing the risks for both infected and non-infected patients.', 'Although COVID-19 presents primarily as a lower respiratory tract infection transmitted via air droplets, increasing data suggest multiorgan involvement in patients that are infected. This systemic involvement is postulated to be mainly related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus binding on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors located on several different human cells. Lung involvement is the most common serious manifestation of the disease, ranging from asymptomatic disease or mild pneumonia, to severe disease associated with hypoxia, critical disease associated with shock, respiratory failure and multiorgan failure or death. Among patients with COVID-19, underlying cardiovascular comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and especially cardiovascular disease, has been associated with adverse outcomes, whereas the emergence of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure and arrhythmias, has been associated with poor survival. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also frequently encountered and may persist for several days. Haematological complications are frequent as well and have been associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, recent studies have reported that over a third of infected patients develop a broad spectrum of neurological symptoms affecting the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscles, including anosmia and ageusia. The skin, the kidneys, the liver, the endocrine organs and the eyes are also affected by the systemic COVID-19 disease. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the organ-specific systemic manifestations of COVID-19.', 'COVID-19 infection may cause severe respiratory distress and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Impaired cardiac function and/or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be associated with poor prognosis. In the present study, we report a comprehensive cardiovascular characterization in the first consecutive collective of patients that was admitted and treated at the University Hospital of Tübingen, Germany. 123 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were included. Routine blood sampling, transthoracic echocardiography and electrocardiography were performed at hospital admission. We found that impaired left-ventricular and right-ventricular function as well as tricuspid regurgitation\\u2009>\\u2009grade 1 were significantly associated with higher mortality. Furthermore, elevated levels of myocardial distress markers (troponin-I and NT pro-BNP) were associated with poor prognosis in this patient collective. Impaired cardiac function is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 positive patients. Consequently, treatment of these patients should include careful guideline-conform cardiovascular evaluation and treatment. Thus, formation of a competent Cardio-COVID-19 team may represent a major clinical measure to optimize therapy of cardiovascular patients during this pandemic.', 'Due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection–related severe pulmonary tissue damages associated with a relative specific widespread thrombotic microangiopathy, the pathophysiologic role of heart–lung interactions becomes crucial for the development and progression of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. The high resistance in the pulmonary circulation, as a result of small vessel thrombosis and hypoxemia, is the major cause of right heart failure associated with a particularly high mortality in severe COVID-19. Timely identification of patients at high risk for RV failure, optimization of mechanical ventilation to limit its adverse effects on RV preload and afterload, avoidance of medication-related increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure with hemodynamic instability, before RV failure develops, can improve patient survival. Since it was confirmed that the right-sided heart is particularly involved in the clinical deterioration of patients with COVID-19 and pressure overload-induced RV dysfunction plays a key role for patient outcome, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) received increasing attention. Limited TTE focused on the right heart appears highly useful in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and particularly beneficial for monitoring of critically ill patients. In addition to detection of right-sided heart dilation and RV dysfunction, it enables assessment of RV-pulmonary arterial coupling and evaluation of RV adaptability to pressure loading which facilitate useful prognostic statements to be made. The increased use of bedside TTE focused on the right heart could facilitate more personalized management and treatment of hospitalized patients and can contribute towards reducing the high mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant global event in the history of infectious diseases. The SARS-CoV-2 appears to have originated from bats but is now easily transmissible among humans, primarily through droplet or direct contact. Clinical features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to ARDS. Respiratory failure can occur rapidly after this. The primary laboratory findings include lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin, and CRP levels may correlate with disease severity. Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan. Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD. Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality. Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged. However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city. The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been demonstrated to be the cause of pneumonia. Nevertheless, it has not been reported as the cause of acute myocarditis or fulminant myocarditis. A 63-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia and cardiac symptoms. He was genetically confirmed as having COVID-19 according to sputum testing on the day of admission. He also had elevated troponin I (Trop I) level (up to 11.37\\xa0g/L) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography. The highest level of interleukin-6 was 272.40\\xa0pg/ml. Bedside chest radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia. Laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative. The patient conformed to the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese expert consensus statement for fulminant myocarditis. After receiving antiviral therapy and mechanical life support, Trop I was reduced to 0.10\\xa0g/L, and interleukin-6 was reduced to 7.63\\xa0pg/mL. Moreover, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%. The patient died of aggravation of secondary infection on the 33rd day of hospitalization. COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure. This is the first report of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis. The mechanism of cardiac pathology caused by COVID-19 needs further study.', 'The new coronavirus disease outbreak in 2019 (COVID-19) represents a dramatic challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. As to viral tropism, lungs are not the only COVID-19 target but also the heart may be involved in a not negligible percentage of the infected patients. Myocarditis-related cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias are the main aftermaths. A few studies showed that myocardial injury in adult patients is often linked with a fatal outcome. Conversely, scientific evidence in children is sparse, although several reports were published with the description of a cardiac involvement in COVID-19 paediatric patients. In these young subjects, a background of surgically treated congenital heart disease seems to be a predisposing factor. Conclusion: This systematic review is aimed at summarizing all COVID-19 cases with a cardiac involvement published in paediatric age and trying to explain the underlying mechanisms responsible for COVID-19-related myocardial damage.', 'The World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggest that individuals over the age of 70\\xa0years or with underlying cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID-19. However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors is unknown in many countries. We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3\\xa0years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic. Findings can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning.', '', 'Studies have reminded that cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities made patients more susceptible to suffer 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19), and exacerbated the infection. The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular\\xa0disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.', 'The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a serious global threat to human health and the economy. Based on accumulating evidence, its continuous progression involves not only pulmonary injury but also damage to the cardiovascular system due to intertwined pathophysiological risks. As a point of convergence in the pathophysiologic process between COVID-19 and heart failure (HF), cytokine storm induces the progression of COVID-19 in patients presenting pre-existing or new onset myocardial damage and even HF. Cytokine storm, as a trigger of the progression of HF in patients with COVID-19, has become a novel focus to explore therapies for target populations. In this review, we briefly introduce the basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and illuminate the mechanism and links among COVID-19, cytokine storm, and HF. Furthermore, we discuss drugs and therapeutic targets for patients with COVID-19 and HF.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the cause of significant global morbidity and mortality. Here, we review the literature to date of the short-term and long-term consequences of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the heart. Early case reports described a spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. However, in most cases, myocardial injury in COVID-19 appears to be predominantly mediated by the severity of critical illness rather than direct injury to myocardium from viral particles. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging remains a powerful tool for diagnosing acute myocarditis, it should be used judiciously in light of low baseline prevalence of myocarditis. Guiding an athletic patient through return to play (RTP) after COVID-19 infection is a challenging process. More recent data show RTP has been a safe endeavor using a screening protocol. “Long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been described. The reported symptoms span a large breadth of cardiopulmonary and neurologic complaints including fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, breathlessness, brain fog, and dysautonomia including postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Management of POTS/dysautonomia primarily centers on education, exercise, and salt and fluid repletion. Our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is constantly evolving. As we enter a new age of survivorship, additional research is needed to catalogue the burden of persistent cardiopulmonary symptoms. Research is also needed to learn how acute management may alter the likelihood and prevalence of this chronic syndrome.', 'From January 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) originated in China has spread around the world. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in COVID-19 patients suggests the existence of a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac disease. The Notch signalling is a major regulator of cardiovascular function and it is also implicated in several biological processes mediating viral infections. In this report we discuss the possibility to target Notch signalling to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and interfere with the progression of COVID-19- associated heart and lungs disease.', '', 'Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic affecting people at high risk and particularly at advanced age, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. As cardiovascular patients are at high risk but also have dyspnea and fatigue as leading symptoms, prevention, diagnostics and treatment in these patients are important to provide adequate care for those with or without COVID-19 but most importantly when comorbid cardiovascular conditions are present. Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) is challenging as patients with elevated myocardial markers such as troponin are at enhanced high risk for fatal outcomes. As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as the viral receptor for cell entry and as the Coronavirus is downregulating this enzyme, which provides cardiovascular and pulmonary protection, there is ongoing discussions on whether treatment with cardiovascular drugs, which upregulate the viral receptor ACE2 should be modified. As most of the COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and heart failure, which imposes a high risk on these patients, cardiovascular therapy should not be modified or even withdrawn. As cardiac injury is a common feature of COVID-19 associated ARDS and is linked with poor outcomes, swift diagnostic management and specialist care of cardiovascular patients in the area of COVID-19 is of particular importance and deserves special attention.', 'Today world thinks about coronavirus disease that which means all even this pandemic disease is not unique.\\xa0The purpose of this study is to detect the role of machine-learning applications and algorithms in investigating and various purposes that deals with COVID-19. Review of the studies that had been published during 2020 and were related to this topic by seeking in Science Direct, Springer, Hindawi, and MDPI using COVID-19, machine learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning as keywords. The total articles obtained were 16,306 overall but after limitation; only 14 researches of these articles were included in this study. Our findings show that machine learning can produce an important role in COVID-19 investigations, prediction, and discrimination. In conclusion, machine learning can be involved in the health provider programs and plans to assess and triage the COVID-19 cases. Supervised learning showed better results than other Unsupervised learning algorithms by having 92.9% testing accuracy. In the future recurrent supervised learning can be utilized for superior accuracy.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with first symptoms similar to the flu. COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly spreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets, deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of COVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models retained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.', 'We conducted a nationwide, registry-based study to investigate the importance of 34 potential risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis, hospitalization (with or without intensive care unit [ICU] admission), and subsequent all-cause mortality. The study population comprised all COVID-19 cases confirmed in Sweden by mid-September 2020 (68,575 non-hospitalized, 2494 ICU hospitalized, and 13,589 non-ICU hospitalized) and 434,081 randomly sampled general-population controls. Older age was the strongest risk factor for hospitalization, although the odds of ICU hospitalization decreased after 60–69\\xa0years and, after controlling for other risk factors, the odds of non-ICU hospitalization showed no trend after 40–49\\xa0years. Residence in a long-term care facility was associated with non-ICU hospitalization. Male sex and the presence of at least one investigated comorbidity or prescription medication were associated with both ICU and non-ICU hospitalization. Three comorbidities associated with both ICU and non-ICU hospitalization were asthma, hypertension, and Down syndrome. History of cancer was not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, but cancer in the past year was associated with non-ICU hospitalization, after controlling for other risk factors. Cardiovascular disease was weakly associated with non-ICU hospitalization for COVID-19, but not with ICU hospitalization, after adjustment for other risk factors. Excess mortality was observed in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 cases. These results confirm that severe COVID-19 is related to age, sex, and comorbidity in general. The study provides new evidence that hypertension, asthma, Down syndrome, and residence in a long-term care facility are associated with severe COVID-19.', 'COVID-19 has a varied clinical presentation. Elderly patients with comorbidities are more vulnerable to severe disease. This study identifies specific symptoms and comorbidities predicting severe COVID-19 and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A literature search identified studies indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health before 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and extracted data. Quality appraisal was performed using STROBE criteria. Random effects meta-analysis identified symptoms and comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 or ICU admission. Seven studies (including 1813 COVID-19 patients) were included. ICU patients were older (62.4\\xa0years) than non-ICU (46\\xa0years), with a greater proportion of males. Dyspnoea was the only symptom predictive for severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83–7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28–10.0). COPD was the strongest predictive comorbidity for severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44–16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56–48.2), followed by cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Dyspnoea was the only symptom predictive for severe COVID-19 and ICU admission. Patients with COPD, cardiovascular disease and hypertension were\\xa0at higher risk of severe illness and ICU admission.', 'In this study, we aimed to assess the association between development of cardiac injury and short-term mortality as well as poor in-hospital outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and highly suspicious patients with compatible chest computed tomography features. Cardiac injury was defined as a rise of serum high sensitivity cardiac Troponin-I level above 99th percentile (men:\\u2009>\\u200926\\xa0ng/mL, women:\\u2009>\\u200911\\xa0ng/mL). A total of 386 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Cardiac injury was present among 115 (29.8%) of the study population. The development of cardiac injury was significantly associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to those with normal troponin levels (40.9% vs 11.1%, p value\\u2009<\\u20090.001). It was shown that patients with cardiac injury had a significantly lower survival rate after a median follow-up of 18\\xa0days from symptom onset (p log-rank\\u2009<\\u20090.001). It was further demonstrated in the multivariable analysis that cardiac injury could possibly increase the risk of short-term mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (HR\\u2009=\\u20091.811, p-value\\u2009=\\u20090.023). Additionally, preexisting cardiovascular disease, malignancy, blood oxygen saturation <\\u200990%, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia at presentation were independently associated with a greater risk of developing cardiac injury. Development of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality and poor in-hospital outcomes. Additionally, it was shown that development of cardiac injury was associated with a lower short-term survival rate compared to patients without myocardial damage and could independently increase the risk of short-term mortality by nearly two-fold.', 'Emerging evidence points to an association between severe clinical presentation of COVID-19 and increased risk of thromboembolism. One-third of patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 develops macrovascular thrombotic complications, including venous thromboembolism, myocardial injury/infarction and stroke. Concurrently, the autopsy series indicate multiorgan damage pattern consistent with microvascular injury. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy has distinct features, including markedly elevated D-dimers concentration with nearly normal activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and platelet count. The diagnosis may be challenging due to overlapping features between pulmonary embolism and severe COVID-19 disease, such as dyspnoea, high concentration of D-dimers, right ventricle with dysfunction or enlargement, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both macro- and microvascular complications are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Therefore, early recognition of coagulation abnormalities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are critical measures to identify patients with poor prognosis, guide antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, and improve patients’ clinical outcomes. Most of the guidelines and consensus documents published on behalf of professional societies focused on thrombosis and hemostasis advocate the use of anticoagulants in all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as 2-6 weeks post hospital discharge in the absence of contraindications. However, since there is no guidance for deciding the intensity and duration of anticoagulation, the decision-making process should be made in individual-case basis. Here, we review the mechanistic relationships between inflammation and thrombosis, discuss the macrovascular and microvascular complications and summarize the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of thromboembolism in patients affected by COVID-19.', 'Information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized Covid-19 patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) is limited in the Arab region. This study aims to fill this gap. In this single-center retrospective study, medical records of hospitalized adults with confirmed Covid-19 [RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2] at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC)-King Khaled University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May to July 2020 were analyzed. Clinical, radiological and serological information, as well as outcomes were recorded and analyzed. A total of 439 patients were included (median age 55\\xa0years; 68.3% men). The most prevalent comorbidities were vitamin D deficiency (74.7%), DM (68.3%), hypertension (42.6%) and obesity (42.2%). During hospitalization, 77 out of the 439 patients (17.5%) died. DM patients have a significantly higher death rate (20.5% versus 12.3%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.04) and lower survival time (p\\u2009=\\u20090.016) than non-DM. Multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that age [Hazards ratio, HR 3.0 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.7–5.3); p\\u2009<\\u20090.001], congestive heart failure [adjusted HR 3.5 (CI 1.4–8.3); p\\u2009=\\u20090.006], smoking [adjusted HR 5.8 (CI 2.0–17.2); p\\u2009<\\u20090.001], β-blocker use [adjusted HR 1.7 (CI 1.0–2.9); p\\u2009=\\u20090.04], bilateral lung infiltrates [adjusted HR 1.9 (CI 1.1–3.3); p\\u2009=\\u20090.02], creatinine\\u2009>\\u200990\\xa0µmol/l [adjusted HR 2.1 (CI 1.3–3.5); p\\u2009=\\u20090.004] and 25(OH)D\\u2009<\\u200912.5\\xa0nmol/l [adjusted HR 7.0 (CI 1.7–28.2); p\\u2009=\\u20090.007] were significant predictors of mortality among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Random blood glucose\\u2009≥\\u200911.1\\xa0mmol/l was significantly associated with intensive care admission [adjusted HR 1.5 (CI 1.0–2.2); p\\u2009=\\u20090.04], as well as smoking, β-blocker use, neutrophil\\u2009>\\u20097.5, creatinine\\u2009>\\u200990\\xa0µmol/l and alanine aminotransferase\\u2009>\\u200965U/l. The prevalence of DM is high among hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While DM patients have a higher mortality rate than their non-DM counterparts, other factors such as old age, congestive heart failure, smoking, β-blocker use, presence of bilateral lung infiltrates, elevated creatinine and severe vitamin D deficiency, appear to be more significant predictors of fatal outcome. Patients with acute metabolic dysfunctions, including hyperglycemia on admission are more likely to receive intensive care.', 'Early diagnosis of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for controlling this pandemic. COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly all over the world. There is no vaccine available for this virus yet. Fast and accurate COVID-19 screening is possible using computed tomography (CT) scan images. The deep learning techniques used in the proposed method is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our manuscript focuses on differentiating the CT scan images of COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 CT using different deep learning techniques. A self-developed model named CTnet-10 was designed for the COVID-19 diagnosis, having an accuracy of 82.1%. Also, other models that we tested are DenseNet-169, VGG-16, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and VGG-19. The VGG-19 proved to be superior with an accuracy of 94.52% as compared to all other deep learning models. Automated diagnosis of COVID-19 from the CT scan pictures can be used by the doctors as a quick and efficient method for COVID-19 screening.', 'Data show that children are less severely affected with SARS-Covid-19 than adults; however, there have been a small proportion of children who have been critically unwell. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify and describe which underlying comorbidities may be associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 disease and death. The study protocol was in keeping with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 1726 articles were identified of which 28 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The 28 studies included 5686 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from mild to severe disease. We focused on the 108 patients who suffered from severe/critical illness requiring ventilation, which included 17 deaths. Of the 108 children who were ventilated, the medical history was available for 48 patients. Thirty-six of the 48 patients (75%) had documented comorbidities of which 11/48 (23%) had pre-existing cardiac disease. Of the 17 patients who died, the past medical history was reported in 12 cases. Of those, 8/12 (75%) had comorbidities. Conclusion: Whilst only a small number of children suffer from COVID-19 disease compared to adults, children with comorbidities, particularly pre-existing cardiac conditions, represent a large proportion of those that became critically unwell.', 'Covid-19 is a global threat that pushes health care to its limits. Since there is neither a vaccine nor a drug for Covid-19, people with an increased risk for severe and fatal courses of disease particularly need protection. Furthermore, factors increasing these risks are of interest in the search of potential treatments. A systematic literature review on the risk factors of severe and fatal Covid-19 courses is presented. The review is carried out on PubMed and a publicly available preprint dataset. For analysis, risk factors are categorized and information regarding the study such as study size and location are extracted. The results are compared to risk factors listed by four public authorities from different countries. The 28 records included, eleven of which are preprints, indicate that conditions and comorbidities connected to a poor state of health such as high age, obesity, diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for severe and fatal disease courses. Furthermore, severe and fatal courses are associated with organ damages mainly affecting the heart, liver and kidneys. Coagulation dysfunctions could play a critical role in the organ damaging. Time to hospital admission, tuberculosis, inflammation disorders and coagulation dysfunctions are identified as risk factors found in the review but not mentioned by the public authorities. Factors associated with increased risk of severe or fatal disease courses were identified, which include conditions connected with a poor state of health as well as organ damages and coagulation dysfunctions. The results may facilitate upcoming Covid-19 research.', 'COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is not only an enzyme but also a functional receptor on cell surfaces through which SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells and is highly expressed in the heart, kidneys, and lungs and shed into the plasma. ACE2 is a key regulator of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). SARS-CoV-2 causes ACE/ACE2 balance disruption and RAAS activation, which leads ultimately to COVID-19 progression, especially in patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, ACE2 expression may have paradoxical effects, aiding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, yet conversely limiting viral infection. This article reviews the existing literature and knowledge of ACE2 in COVID-19 setting and focuses on its pathophysiologic involvement in disease progression, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic potential.', 'The pandemia of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 355,000 confirmed deaths worldwide. However, publications on postmortem findings are scarce. We present the pulmonary findings in four cases of fatal COVID-19 with a spectrum of lung pathology reflecting disease course and duration, invasive therapies, and laboratory features. Early disease is characterized by neutrophilic, exudative capillaritis with microthrombosis and high levels of IL-1beta and IL-6. Later stages are associated with diffuse alveolar damage and ongoing intravascular thrombosis in small to medium-sized pulmonary vessels, occasionally with areas of infarction equivalents, accompanied by laboratory features of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In late stages, organizing pneumonia with extensive intra-alveolar proliferation of fibroblasts and marked metaplasia of alveolar epithelium can be observed. Viral RNA is encountered in the lung, with virus particles in endothelial cells and pneumocytes. In many patients, multi-organ failure with severe liver damage sets in finally, possibly as consequence of an early-onset pro-inflammatory cytokine storm and/or thrombotic microangiopathy.', '', 'The COronaVirus DISease 19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older age and presence of comorbidities, including diabetes, were shown to be associated with a more severe course and a higher fatality rate. Studies from the most affected countries, including China, United States and Italy, seem to indicate that prevalence of diabetes among patients affected by COVID-19 is not higher than that observed in the general population, thus suggesting that diabetes is not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, a large body of evidence demonstrate that diabetes is a risk factor for disease progression towards critical illness, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation or admission to intensive care unit, and ultimately death. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes remain to be elucidated. In particular, it is still unresolved whether is diabetes per se, especially if poorly controlled, or rather the various comorbidities/complications associated with it that predispose patients with COVID-19 to a worse prognosis. In fact, conditions that cluster with diabetes in the context of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and hypertension, or complicate chronic hyperglycemia, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, have also been associated with poor prognosis in these individuals and the available studies have not consistently shown that diabetes predict disease severity independently of them.', 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the recent past. People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic. This review summarises the current knowledge and perceived challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.', 'The main aim of this study was to find the prevalence of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 infected patients and associated risk factors for death. Three electronic databases including PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant cohort studies of COVID-19 disease from January 1, 2020, to August 11, 2020. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence rate (PR), risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for both effect measures. Cochrane chi-square test statistic Q, \\\\({I}^{2}\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\tau }^{2}\\\\) tests were used to measure the presence of heterogeneity. Publication bias and sensitivity of the included studies\\xa0were also tested. In this meta-analysis, a total of 58 studies with 122,191 patients were analyzed. The pooled prevalence rate of mortality among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 18.88%, 95% CI (16.46–21.30), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001. Highest mortality was found in Europe [PR 26.85%, 95% CI (19.41–34.29), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001] followed by North America [PR 21.47%, 95% CI (16.27–26.68), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001] and Asia [PR 14.83%, 95% CI (12.46- 17.21), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001]. An significant association were found between mortality among COVID-19 infected patients and older age (>\\u200965\\xa0years vs.\\u2009<\\u200965\\xa0years) [RR 3.59, 95% CI (1.87–6.90), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001], gender (male vs. female) [RR 1.63, 95% CI (1.43–1.87), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001], ICU admitted patients [RR 3.72, 95% CI (2.70–5.13), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001], obesity [RR 2.18, 95% CI (1.10–4.34), p\\u2009<\\u20090.05], hypertension [RR 2.08,95% CI (1.79–2.43) p\\u2009<\\u20090.001], diabetes [RR 1.87, 95% CI (1.23–2.84), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001], cardiovascular disease [RR 2.51, 95% CI (1.20–5.26), p\\u2009<\\u20090.05], and\\xa0cancer [RR 2.31, 95% CI (1.80–2.97), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001]. In addition, significant association for high risk of mortality were also found for cerebrovascular disease,\\xa0COPD, coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease and chronic kidney disease. This meta-analysis revealed that the mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was highest in the European region and older age, gender, ICU patients, patients with comorbidity had\\xa0a high risk for case fatality. Those findings would help the health care providers to reduce the mortality rate and combat this pandemic to save lives using limited resources.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease which has had a rapid surge in cases and deaths since it is first documented in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is caused by the Betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is highly expressed in the human lower respiratory tract but also in other tissues, as the cellular entry receptor. Thus, COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system but can cause damage to other body systems, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, renal, and central nervous systems. We review the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of the infection, focusing on our current understanding of the disease mechanisms and their translation to clinical outcomes, as well as adverse effects on different body systems. We also discuss the epidemiology pathogenesis, clinical, and multi-organ consequences, and highlight some of the research gaps regarding COVID-19.', 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global public health concern; however, relatively few detailed reports of related cardiac injury are available. The aims of this study were to compare the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of inpatients in the intensive-care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. We recruited 416 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and divided them into two groups: ICU (n\\u2009=\\u200935) and non-ICU (n\\u2009=\\u2009381). Medical histories, laboratory findings, and echocardiography data were compared. The levels of myocardial injury markers in ICU vs non-ICU patients were as follows: troponin I (0.029\\xa0ng/mL [0.007–0.063] vs 0.006\\xa0ng/mL [0.006–0.006]) and myoglobin (65.45\\xa0μg/L [39.77–130.57] vs 37.00\\xa0μg/L [26.40–53.54]). Echocardiographic findings included ventricular wall thickening (12 [39%] vs 1 [4%]), pulmonary hypertension (9 [29%] vs 0 [0%]), and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (5 [16%] vs 0 [0%]). Overall, 10% of the ICU patients presented with right heart enlargement, thickened right-ventricular wall, decreased right heart function, and pericardial effusion. Cardiac complications were more common in ICU patients, including acute cardiac injury (21 [60%] vs 13 [3%]) (including 2 cases of fulminant myocarditis), atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia (3 [9%] vs 3 [1%]), and acute heart failure (5 [14%] vs 0 [0%]). Myocardial injury marker elevation, ventricular wall thickening, pulmonary artery hypertension, and cardiac complications including acute myocardial injury, arrhythmia, and acute heart failure are more common in ICU patients with COVID-19. Cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients may be related more to the systemic response after infection rather than direct damage by coronavirus.', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects host cells following binding with the cell surface ACE2 receptors, thereby leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 causes viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and major complications, including acute myocardial injury, arrhythmia, and shock mainly in elderly patients. Furthermore, patients with existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension and coronary heart disease, have a worse clinical outcome following contraction of the viral illness. A striking feature of COVID-19 pandemics is the high incidence of fatalities in advanced aged patients: this might be due to the prevalence of frailty and cardiovascular disease increase with age due to endothelial dysfunction and loss of endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms. Although experimental evidence on this topic is still at its infancy, the aim of this position paper is to hypothesize and discuss more suggestive cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby SARS-CoV-2 may lead to detrimental consequences to the cardiovascular system. We will focus on aging, cytokine storm, NLRP3/inflammasome, hypoxemia, and air pollution, which is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor associated with rapid urbanization and globalization. We will finally discuss the impact of clinically available CV drugs on the clinical course of COVID-19 patients. Understanding the role played by SARS-CoV2 on the CV system is indeed mandatory to get further insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and to design a therapeutic strategy of cardio-protection for frail patients.', 'Hyperglycaemia is associated with an elevated risk of mortality in community-acquired pneumonia, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, trauma and surgery, among other conditions. In this study, we examined the relationship between fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 28-day mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients not previously diagnosed as having diabetes. We conducted a retrospective study involving all consecutive COVID-19 patients with a definitive 28-day outcome and FBG measurement at admission from 24 January 2020 to 10 February 2020 in two hospitals based in Wuhan, China. Demographic and clinical data, 28-day outcomes, in-hospital complications and CRB-65 scores of COVID-19 patients in the two hospitals were analysed. CRB-65 is an effective measure for assessing the severity of pneumonia and is based on four indicators, i.e. confusion, respiratory rate (>30/min), systolic blood pressure (≤90\\xa0mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure (≤60\\xa0mmHg), and age (≥65\\xa0years). Six hundred and five COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 114 who died in hospital. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age (HR 1.02 [95% CI 1.00, 1.04]), male sex (HR 1.75 [95% CI 1.17, 2.60]), CRB-65 score 1–2 (HR 2.68 [95% CI 1.56, 4.59]), CRB-65 score 3–4 (HR 5.25 [95% CI 2.05, 13.43]) and FBG ≥7.0\\xa0mmol/l (HR 2.30 [95% CI 1.49, 3.55]) were independent predictors for 28-day mortality. The OR for 28-day in-hospital complications in those with FBG ≥7.0\\xa0mmol/l and 6.1–6.9\\xa0mmol/l vs <6.1\\xa0mmol/l was 3.99 (95% CI 2.71, 5.88) or 2.61 (95% CI 1.64, 4.41), respectively. FBG ≥7.0\\xa0mmol/l at admission is an independent predictor for 28-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 without previous diagnosis of diabetes. Glycaemic testing and control are important to all COVID-19 patients even where they have no pre-existing diabetes, as most COVID-19 patients are prone to glucose metabolic disorders. Graphical abstract', 'In the era of the current COVID-19 health crisis, the aim of the present study was to explore population behavior as regards the visits in the Εmergency Cardiology department (ECD) of a tertiary General Hospital that does not hospitalize SARS-CoV-2 infected patients Daily number of visits at the EDC and admissions to Cardiology Wards and Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary General Hospital, in Athens, Greece, were retrieved from hospital’s database (January 1st–April 30th 2018, 2019 and 2020). A highly significant reduction in the visits at ECD of the hospital during March and April 2020 was observed as compared with January and February of the same year (p for linear trend\\u2009<\\u2009·001); in particular the number of visits was 41.1% lower in March 2020 and 32.7% lower in April 2020, as compared to January 2020. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases throughout the country increased (i.e., from February 26th to April 2nd) the number of visits at ECD decreased (p\\u2009=\\u20090.01), whereas, the opposite was observed in the period afterwards (p\\u2009=\\u20090.01).The number of acute Myocardial infarctions (MI) cases in March 2020 was the lowest compared to the entire three year period (p\\u2009<\\u20090·001); however, the number of acute MI cases in April 2020 was doubled as compared to March 2020, but still was lower than the preceding years (p\\u2009<\\u20090·001). It is hard to explain the mystery of the “missing” emergency hospital visits. However, if this decline in cardiovascular disease related hospital visits is “true”, it is something that needs to be rigorously studied, to learn how to keep these rates down.', '', 'Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported in up to 25% of critically-ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in those with underlying comorbidities. AKI is associated with high mortality rates in this setting, especially when renal replacement therapy is required. Several studies have highlighted changes in urinary sediment, including proteinuria and hematuria, and evidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 excretion, suggesting the presence of a renal reservoir for the virus.\\nThe pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI could be related to unspecific mechanisms but also to COVID-specific mechanisms such as direct cellular injury resulting from viral entry through the receptor (ACE2) which is highly expressed in the kidney, an imbalanced renin–angotensin–aldosteron system, pro-inflammatory cytokines elicited by the viral infection and thrombotic events. Non-specific mechanisms include haemodynamic alterations, right heart failure, high levels of PEEP in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, hypovolemia, administration of nephrotoxic drugs and nosocomial sepsis. To date, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 induced AKI. A number of investigational agents are being explored for antiviral/immunomodulatory treatment of COVID-19 and their impact on AKI is still unknown. Indications, timing and modalities of renal replacement therapy currently rely on non-specific data focusing on patients with sepsis. Further studies focusing on AKI in COVID-19 patients are urgently warranted in order to predict the risk of AKI, to identify the exact mechanisms of renal injury and to suggest targeted interventions.\\n', 'The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 is produced by SARS-CoV-2. WHO has declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency, with the most susceptible populations (requiring ventilation) being the elderly, pregnant women and people with associated co-morbidities including heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and cancer. However, such general guidance does not provide information regarding COVID-19 risks in patients with suffering from pre-existing thyroid problems, and furthermore, we do not know whether patients with COVID-19 (symptomatic or without symptoms), who have not previously had thyroid issues develop endocrine thyroid dysfunction after infection. The European Society for Endocrinology recently published a statement on COVID-19 and endocrine diseases (Endocrine, 2020); however, thyroid diseases were not mentioned specifically. We have therefore reviewed the current literature on thyroid diseases (excluding cancer) and COVID-19, including data from the previous coronavirus pandemic caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the same family Coronaviridae leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At the moment there are no data suggesting that thyroid patients are at higher risk of COVID-19, but this requites further research and data analysis.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic threat. The potential involvement of COVID-19 in central nervous system (CNS) has attracted considerable attention due to neurological manifestations presented throughout the disease process. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is structurally similar to SARS-CoV, and both bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. Thus, cells expressing ACE2, such as neurons and glial cells may act as targets and are thus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we have reviewed the neurological characteristics of COVID-19 and summarized possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the CNS. COVID-19 patients have presented with a number of different neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, hyposmia, and hypogeusia during the course of illness. It has also been reported recently that some cases of COVID-19 have presented with concurrent acute cerebrovascular disease (acute ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage), meningitis/encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and acute Guillain–Barré syndrome. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in a cerebrospinal fluid specimen of a patient with COVID-19 have provided direct evidence to support the theory of neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2. However, the underlying neurotropic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are yet to be established. SARS-CoV-2 may affect CNS through two direct mechanisms (hematogenous dissemination or neuronal retrograde dissemination) or via indirect routes. The underlying mechanisms require further elucidation in the future.', 'In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a significant threat to international health. COVID-19 is highly infectious and can lead to fatal comorbidities especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, fully understanding the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS is conducive to early identification and precise treatment. We aimed to describe the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS and to elucidate the differences from ARDS caused by other factors. COVID-19 mainly affected the respiratory system with minor damage to other organs. Injury to the alveolar epithelial cells was the main cause of COVID-19-related ARDS, and endothelial cells were less damaged with therefore less exudation. The clinical manifestations were relatively mild in some COVID-19 patients, which was inconsistent with the severity of laboratory and imaging findings. The onset time of COVID-19-related ARDS was 8–12\\u2009days, which was inconsistent with ARDS Berlin criteria, which defined a 1-week onset limit. Some of these patients might have a relatively normal lung compliance. The severity was redefined into three stages according to its specificity: mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe. HFNO can be safe in COVID-19-related ARDS patients, even in some moderate-severe patients. The more likely cause of death is severe respiratory failure. Thus, the timing of invasive mechanical ventilation is very important. The effects of corticosteroids in COVID-19-related ARDS patients were uncertain. We hope to help improve the prognosis of severe cases and reduce the mortality.', 'Nowadays, the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation. Complications such as hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19. No meta-analysis has explored if or not diabetes related to mortality of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this meta-analysis first aims to explore the possible clinical mortality between diabetes and COVID-19, analyze if diabetes patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are exposed to the worst clinical prognostic risk, and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence. Our results showed a close relationship between diabetes and mortality of COVID-19, with a pooled OR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.31–2.36; P\\u2009=\\u20090.0002). The pooled data were calculated with the fixed effects model (FEM) as no heterogeneity appeared in the studies. Sensitivity analysis showed that after omitting any single study or converting a random effect model to FEM, the main results still held. Our meta-analysis showed that diabetes increases the mortality of patients with COVID-19. These results indicated the disturbance of blood glucose in the COVID-19 patients. More importantly, this meta-analysis grades the reliability of evidence for further basic and clinical research into the diabetes dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.', 'Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) is a pediatric hyperinflammation disorder caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has now been reported from several countries the world over. Some of the clinical manifestations of MIS-C mimic Kawasaki disease (KD) shock syndrome. MIS-C develops 4–6\\xa0weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and is presumably initiated by adaptive immune response. Though it has multisystem involvement, it is the cardiovascular manifestations that are most prominent. High titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are seen in these patients. As this is a new disease entity, its immunopathogenesis is not fully elucidated. Whether it has some overlap with KD is still unclear. Current treatment guidelines recommend use of intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose corticosteroids as first-line treatment. Mortality rates of MIS-C are lower compared to adult forms of severe COVID-19 disease.', 'Coronavirus is a fatal disease that affects mammals and birds. Usually, this virus spreads in humans through aerial precipitation of any fluid secreted from the infected entity’s body part. This type of virus is fatal than other unpremeditated viruses. Meanwhile, another class of coronavirus was developed in December 2019, named Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), first seen in Wuhan, China. From January 23, 2020, the number of affected individuals from this virus rapidly increased in Wuhan and other countries. This research proposes a system for classifying and analyzing the predictions obtained from symptoms of this virus. The proposed system aims to determine those attributes that help in the early detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This work computes the accuracy of different machine learning classifiers and selects the best classifier for COVID-19 detection based on comparative analysis. ANFIS is used to model and control ill-defined and uncertain systems to predict this globally spread disease’s risk factor. COVID-19 dataset is classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) because it achieved the highest accuracy of 100% among all classifiers. Furthermore, the ANFIS model is implemented on this classified dataset, which results in an 80% risk prediction for COVID-19.', 'Emerging evidence from China suggests that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is deadlier for infected men than women with a 2.8% fatality rate being reported in Chinese men versus 1.7% in women. Further, sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 in several European countries show a similar number of cases between the sexes, but more severe outcomes in aged men. Case fatality is highest in men with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men. The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China. We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging. Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies. The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender. The ongoing and planned prophylactic and therapeutic treatment studies must include prospective sex- and gender-sensitive analyses.', 'To analyze the application of a lung ultrasound (LUS)-based diagnostic approach to patients suspected of COVID-19, combining the LUS likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia with patient’s symptoms and clinical history. This is an international multicenter observational study in 20 US and European hospitals. Patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test and had an LUS examination. We identified three clinical phenotypes based on pre-existing chronic diseases (mixed phenotype), and on the presence (severe phenotype) or absence (mild phenotype) of signs and/or symptoms of respiratory failure at presentation. We defined the LUS likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia according to four different patterns: high (HighLUS), intermediate (IntLUS), alternative (AltLUS), and low (LowLUS) probability. The combination of patterns and phenotypes with RT-PCR results was described and analyzed. We studied 1462 patients, classified in mild (n\\u2009=\\u2009400), severe (n\\u2009=\\u2009727), and mixed (n\\u2009=\\u2009335) phenotypes. HighLUS and IntLUS showed an overall sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 88.23–91.97%) in identifying patients with positive RT-PCR, with higher values in the mixed (94.7%) and severe phenotype (97.1%), and even higher in those patients with objective respiratory failure (99.3%). The HighLUS showed a specificity of 88.8% (CI 85.55–91.65%) that was higher in the mild phenotype (94.4%; CI 90.0–97.0%). At multivariate analysis, the HighLUS was a strong independent predictor of RT-PCR positivity (odds ratio 4.2, confidence interval 2.6–6.7, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). Combining LUS patterns of probability with clinical phenotypes at presentation can rapidly identify those patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia at bedside. This approach could support and expedite patients’ management during a pandemic surge.', 'The current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly progressed to a global pandemic. There are well-documented cardiac complications of COVID-19 in patients with and without prior cardiovascular disease. The cardiac complications include myocarditis, heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome resulting from coronary artery thrombosis or SARS-CoV-2-related plaque ruptures. There is growing evidence showing that arrhythmias are also one of the major complications. Myocardial inflammation caused by viral infection leads to electrophysiological and structural remodeling as a possible mechanism for arrhythmia. This could also be the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 leads to different arrhythmias. In this review article, we discuss arrhythmia manifestations in COVID-19.', 'COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19. \\n• Provides comprehensive information on the different diagnostic tools available for COVID-19\\n \\n• Nucleic acid based tests or antigen detection tests are used for diagnostic purpose\\n • Accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient management of COVID-19', 'To determine the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and death in obese individuals with a history of bariatric surgery (BS) admitted for COVID-19. All obese inpatients recorded during a hospital stay by the French National Health Insurance were included, and their electronic health data were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who had undergone bariatric surgery comprised the BS group and patients with obesity but no history of BS served as controls. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death and the secondary outcome was the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. 4,248,253 obese individuals aged 15–75\\xa0years were included and followed for a mean observation time of 5.43\\u2009±\\u20092.93\\xa0years. 8286 individuals with a previous diagnosis of obesity were admitted for COVID-19 between January 1 and May 15, 2020. Of these patients, 541 had a history of BS and 7745 did not. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation and death occurred in 7% and 3.5% of the BS group versus 15% and 14.2% of the control group, respectively. In logistic regression, the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, and hypertension, and mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, history of heart failure, cancer, and diabetes, whereas BS had an independent protective effect. Two random exact matching tests confirmed the protective effect of BS. This nationwide study showed that BS is independently associated with a reduced risk of death and invasive mechanical ventilation in obese individuals with COVID-19.', 'Knowledge regarding patients’ clinical condition at severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection is sparse. Data in the international, multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients (LEOSS) cohort study may enhance the understanding of COVID-19. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, enrolled in the LEOSS cohort study between March 16, 2020, and May 14, 2020, were analyzed. Associations between baseline characteristics and clinical stages at diagnosis (uncomplicated vs. complicated) were assessed using logistic regression models. We included 2155 patients, 59.7% (1,287/2,155) were male; the most common age category was 66–85\\xa0years (39.6%; 500/2,155). The primary COVID-19 diagnosis was made in 35.0% (755/2,155) during complicated clinical stages. A significant univariate association between age; sex; body mass index; smoking; diabetes; cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and kidney diseases; ACE inhibitor therapy; statin intake and an increased risk for complicated clinical stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis was found. Multivariable analysis revealed that advanced age [46–65\\xa0years: adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.73, 95% CI 1.25–2.42, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001; 66–85\\xa0years: aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.36–2.74, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001;\\u2009>\\u200985\\xa0years: aOR 2.38, 95% CI 1.49–3.81, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001 vs. individuals aged 26–45\\xa0years], male sex (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01–1.50, p\\u2009=\\u20090.040), cardiovascular disease (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09–1.72, p\\u2009=\\u20090.007), and diabetes (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04–1.69, p\\u2009=\\u20090.023) were associated with complicated stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis. The LEOSS cohort identified age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and male sex as risk factors for complicated disease stages at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, thus confirming previous data. Further data regarding outcomes of the natural course of COVID-19 and the influence of treatment are required.', 'The world is currently witnessing a major devastating pandemic of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This disease is caused by a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It primarily affects the respiratory tract and particularly the lungs. The virus enters the cell by attaching its spike-like surface projections to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) expressed in various tissues. Though the majority of symptomatic patients have mild flu-like symptoms, a significant minority develop severe lung injury with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. Elderly patients with previous cardiovascular comorbidities are particularly susceptible to severe clinical manifestations. Currently, our limited knowledge of the pathologic findings is based on post-mortem biopsies, a few limited autopsies, and very few complete autopsies. From these reports, we know that the virus can be found in various organs but the most striking tissue damage involves the lungs resulting almost always in diffuse alveolar damage with interstitial edema, capillary congestion, and occasional interstitial lymphocytosis, causing hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and death. A few pathology studies have also reported intravascular microthrombi and pulmonary thrombembolism. Although the clinical presentation of this disease is fairly well characterized, knowledge of the pathologic aspects remains comparatively limited. In this review, we discuss clinical, pathologic, and genomic features of COVID-19, review current hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis, and briefly discuss the clinical characteristics. We also compare the salient features of COVID-19 with other coronavirus-related illnesses that have posed significant public health issues in the past, including SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).', 'In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, people need to practice social distancing in order to protect themselves from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In such stressful situations, remote cardiac rehabilitation (CR) might be a viable alternative to the outpatient CR program. We prospectively investigated patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 50%. As for patients who participated in the remote CR program, telephone support was provided by cardiologists and nurses who specialized in HF every 2\\u2009weeks after discharge. The emergency readmission rate within 30\\u2009days of discharge was compared among the outpatient CR, remote CR, and non-CR groups, and the EQ-5D score was compared between the outpatient CR and remote CR groups. The participation rate of HF patients in our remote CR program elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. As observed in the outpatient CR group (n = 69), the emergency readmission rate within 30\\u2009days of discharge was lower in the remote CR group (n = 30) than in the non-CR group (n = 137) (P = 0.02). The EQ-5D score was higher in the remote CR group than in the outpatient CR group (P = 0.03) 30\\u2009days after discharge. Remote CR is as effective as outpatient CR for improving the short-term prognosis of patients hospitalized for heart failure post-discharge. This suggests that the remote CR program can be provided as a good alternative to the outpatient CR program.', '', 'COVID-19 a systemic inflammation involving multiple organs, affecting all age groups, with high mortality rate, severe adverse outcomes, and high economic burden need to be described. A systematic review of systematic reviews conducted. We searched PubMed, OVID Medline, Cochrane library, COVID-19 resource centers of N Engl. J Med, AHA, and LITCOVID. Certainty of evidences was evaluated by GRADE approach. Meta-analysis according to random effects model was conducted. Seventy-one eligible systematic reviews are included in the study. A total of 86.5% of them had high quality, and 13.5% had medium quality. Meta-analysis results are presented in tabular format, and the remaining results are presented in narration fashion. COVID-19 involves blood vessels, lung, heart, nervous system, liver, gastrointestinal system, kidney, eyes, and other organs and infects adult and children, neonates, pregnant women, and elderly, transmitted via air born and droplet. Comorbidities associated with COVID-19 are HTN 20.7%, CVD 9.6%, DM 9.55%, respiratory diseases 7%, and 9% of cigarette smoking. Prognostic factors for mortality among COVID-19 cases are acute cardiac injury, diagnosed CVD, DM, respiratory disease, and HTN. Prognostic factors for disease severity are CVD and HTN. Prognostic factors for disease progression were fever, shortness of breath, and smoking. There is no specific antiviral treatment. Preventive measures including physical distancing of 2\\xa0m and more, using PPE, avoiding social gatherings, quarantine, and isolation have been recommended. Encouraging telemedicine, online training, and homeschooling are highly recommended. Vaccine is approaching, and concerns exist about vaccine with a high efficacy. Modification of CVD and cardiometabolic risk became the cornerstone for sustainable control of pandemic.', 'Corona virus disease (COVID-19) acknowledged as a pandemic by the WHO and mankind all over the world is vulnerable to this virus. Alternative tools are needed that can help in diagnosis of the coronavirus. Researchers of this article investigated the potential of machine learning methods for automatic diagnosis of corona virus with high accuracy from X-ray images. Two most commonly used classifiers were selected: logistic\\xa0regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The main reason was to make the system fast and efficient. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction approach was also investigated based on principal component analysis (PCA) to further speed up the learning process and improve the classification accuracy by selecting the highly discriminate features. The deep learning-based methods demand large amount of training samples compared to conventional approaches, yet adequate amount of labelled training samples was not available for COVID-19 X-ray images. Therefore, data augmentation technique using generative adversarial network (GAN) was employed to further increase the training samples and reduce the overfitting problem. We used the online available dataset and incorporated GAN to have 500 X-ray images in total for this study. Both CNN and LR showed encouraging results for COVID-19 patient identification. The LR and CNN models showed 95.2–97.6% overall accuracy without PCA and 97.6–100% with PCA for positive cases identification, respectively.', 'COronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread at unprecedented speed and scale into a global pandemic with cardiovascular risk factors and complications emerging as important disease modifiers. We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19. SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive. Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19. Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.', 'We report the neuropathological findings of a patient who died from complications of COVID-19. The decedent was initially hospitalized for surgical management of underlying coronary artery disease. He developed post-operative complications and was evaluated with chest imaging studies. The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging results were indicative of COVID-19 and he was subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive. His condition worsened and he died after more than 2\\xa0weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment. The autopsy revealed a range of neuropathological lesions, with features resembling both vascular and demyelinating etiologies. Hemorrhagic white matter lesions were present throughout the cerebral hemispheres with surrounding axonal injury and macrophages. The subcortical white matter had scattered clusters of macrophages, a range of associated axonal injury, and a perivascular acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like appearance. Additional white matter lesions included focal microscopic areas of necrosis with central loss of white matter and marked axonal injury. Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified. Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients’ with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology. The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease. The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill.', 'Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. Diabetic patients tend to have poorer outcomes and more severe disease (Kumar et al. in Diabetes Metab Syndr 14(4):535–545, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.044). However, the vast majority of studies are representative of Asian and Caucasian population and fewer represent an African-American population. In this single-center, retrospective observational study, we included all adult patients (>\\u200918\\xa0years old) admitted to Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients were classified according to having a known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Demographic and clinical data, comorbidities, outcomes and laboratory findings were obtained. Our sample included a total of 355 patients. 70% were African-American, and 47% had diabetes. Patients with diabetes had higher peak inflammatory markers like CRP 184 (111–258) versus 142 (65–229) p\\u2009=\\u20090.012 and peak LDH 560 (384–758) versus 499 (324–655) p\\u2009=\\u20090.017. The need for RRT/HD was significantly higher in patients with diabetes (21% vs 11% p\\u2009=\\u20090.013) as well as the need for vasopressors (28% vs 18% p\\u2009=\\u20090.023). Only age was found to be an independent predictor of mortality. We found no significant differences in inpatient mortality p\\u2009=\\u20090.856, need for RRT/HD p\\u2009=\\u20090.429, need for intubation p\\u2009=\\u20091.000 and need for vasopressors p\\u2009=\\u20090.471 in African-Americans with diabetes when compared to non-African-Americans. Our study demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 and diabetes tend to have more severe disease and poorer clinical outcomes. African-American patients with diabetes did not differ in outcomes or disease severity when compared to non-African-American patients.', 'We are experiencing a historical moment with an unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 will have a long-term and profound impact on older adults’ health and well-being. Social isolation and loneliness are likely to be one of the most affected health outcomes. Social isolation and loneliness are\\xa0major risk factors that have been linked with poor physical and mental health status. This paper discusses several approaches that may address the issues of social isolation and loneliness. These approaches include promoting social connection as public health messaging, mobilizing the resources from family members, community-based networks and resources, developing innovative technology-based interventions to improve social connections, and engaging the health care system to begin the process of developing methods to identify social isolation and loneliness in health care settings.', 'Ultrasound is the most disruptive innovation in intensive care life, above all in this time, with a high diagnostic value when applied appropriately. In recent years, point-of-care lung ultrasound has gained significant popularity as a diagnostic tool in the acutely dyspnoeic patients. In the era of Sars-CoV-2 outbreak, lung ultrasound seems to be strongly adapting to the follow-up for lung involvement of patients with ascertaining infections, till to be used, in our opinion emblematically, as a screening test in suspected patients at the emergency triage or at home\\xa0medical visit. In this brief review, we discuss the lung ultrasound dichotomy, certainties and uncertainties, describing its potential role in validated clinical contexts, as a clinical-dependent exam, its limits and pitfalls in a generic and off-label clinical context, as a virtual anatomical-dependent exam, and its effects on the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.', 'The elderly may represent a specific cluster of high-risk patients for developing COVID-19 with rapidly progressive clinical deterioration. Indeed, in older individuals, immunosenescence and comorbid disorders are more likely to promote viral-induced cytokine storm resulting in life-threatening respiratory failure and multisystemic involvement. Early diagnosis and individualized therapeutic management should be developed for elderly subjects based on personal medical history and polypharmacotherapy. Our review examines the pathogenesis and clinical implications of ageing in COVID-19 patients; finally, we discuss the evidence and controversies in the management in the long-stay residential care homes and aspects of end-of-life care for elderly patients with COVID-19.', 'This document from the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) aims to present the main imaging features, and the role of CT scan in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, describing, in particular, the typical findings which make it possible to identify the disease and distinguish it from bacterial causes of infection, and to define which category of patients may benefit from CT imaging. The precautions that must be taken when performing scans to protect radiologists and technologists from infection will be described. The organisational measures that can be taken within radiology departments in order to cope with the influx of patients, while continuing to manage other emergency and time-sensitive activity (e.g. oncology, other infectious diseases etc.), will be discussed. \\n• Bilateral ground glass opacities are typical CT manifestations of COVID-19.\\n \\n• Crazy paving and organising pneumonia pattern are seen at a later stage.\\n \\n• Extensive consolidation is associated with a poor prognosis.\\n', 'For survivors of severe COVID-19 disease, having defeated the virus is just the beginning of an uncharted recovery path. What follows after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the extension and severity of viral attacks in different cell types and organs. Despite the ridiculously large number of papers that have flooded scientific journals and preprint-hosting websites, a clear clinical picture of COVID-19 aftermath is vague at best. Without larger prospective observational studies that are only now being started, clinicians can retrieve information just from case reports and or small studies. This is the time to understand how COVID-19 goes forward and what consequences survivors may expect to experience. To this aim, a multidisciplinary post-acute care service involving several specialists has been established at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCSS (Rome, Italy). Although COVID-19 is an infectious disease primarily affecting the lung, its multi-organ involvement requires an interdisciplinary approach encompassing virtually all branches of internal medicine and geriatrics. In particular, during the post-acute phase, the geriatrician may serve as the case manager of a multidisciplinary team. The aim of this article is to describe the importance of the interdisciplinary approach––coordinated by geriatrician––to cope the potential post-acute care needs of recovered COVID-19 patients.', 'Technology advancements have a rapid effect on every field of life, be it medical field or any other field. Artificial intelligence has shown the promising results in health care through its decision making by analysing the data. COVID-19 has affected more than 100 countries in a matter of no time. People all over the world are vulnerable to its consequences in future. It is imperative to develop a control system that will detect the coronavirus. One of the solution to control the current havoc can be the diagnosis of disease with the help of various AI tools. In this paper, we classified textual clinical reports into four classes by using classical and ensemble machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering was performed using techniques like Term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF), Bag of words (BOW) and report length. These features were supplied to traditional and ensemble machine learning classifiers. Logistic regression and Multinomial Naïve Bayes showed better results than other ML algorithms by having 96.2% testing accuracy. In future recurrent neural network can be used for better accuracy.', 'The increasing COVID-19 cases in the USA have led to overburdening of healthcare in regard to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) utilization as well as mortality. We aim to identify risk factors associated with poor outcomes (IMV and mortality) of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. A meta-analysis of observational studies with epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and medRxiv from December 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020 following MOOSE guidelines was conducted. Twenty-nine full-text studies detailing epidemiological characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, complications, and outcomes were included. Meta-regression was performed to evaluate effects of comorbidities, and complications on outcomes using a random-effects model. The pooled correlation coefficient (r), 95% CI, and OR were calculated. Of 29 studies (12,258 confirmed cases), 17 reported IMV and 21 reported deaths. The pooled prevalence of IMV was 23.3% (95% CI: 17.1–30.9%), and mortality was 13% (9.3–18%). The age-adjusted meta-regression models showed significant association of mortality with male (r: 0.14; OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.07–1.23; I2: 95.2%), comorbidities including pre-existing cerebrovascular disease (r: 0.35; 1.42 (1.14–1.77); I2: 96.1%), and chronic liver disease (r: 0.08; 1.08 (1.01–1.17); I2: 96.23%), complications like septic shock (r: 0.099; 1.10 (1.02–1.2); I2: 78.12%) and ARDS (r: 0.04; 1.04 (1.02–1.06); I2: 90.3%), ICU admissions (r: 0.03; 1.03 (1.03–1.05); I2: 95.21%), and IMV utilization (r: 0.05; 1.05 (1.03–1.07); I2: 89.80%). Similarly, male (r: 0.08; 1.08 (1.02–1.15); I2: 95%), comorbidities like pre-existing cerebrovascular disease (r: 0.29; 1.34 (1.09–1.63); I2:93.4%), and cardiovascular disease (r: 0.28; 1.32 (1.1–1.58); I2: 89.7%) had higher odds of IMV utilization. COVID-19 patients with comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic liver disease had poor outcomes. Diabetes and hypertension had higher prevalence but no association with mortality and IMV. Our study results will be helpful in right allocation of resources towards patients who need them the most.', 'Due to the overlapping clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza, parallels are often drawn between the two diseases. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are at a higher risk for severe manifestations of both illnesses. Considering the high transmission rate of COVID-19 and with the seasonal influenza approaching in late 2020, the dual epidemics of COVID-19 and influenza pose serious cardiovascular implications. This review highlights the similarities and differences between influenza and COVID-19 and the potential risks associated with coincident pandemics. COVID-19 has a higher mortality compared to influenza with case fatality rate almost 15 times more than that of influenza. Additionally, a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes has been noted in patients with CVD, with ~\\u200915 to 70% of COVID-19 related deaths having an underlying CVD. The critical care need have ranged from 5 to 79% of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19, a proportion substantially higher than with influenza. Similarly, the frequency of vascular thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is markedly higher in COVID-19 patients compared with influenza in which vascular complications are rarely seen. Unexpectedly, while peak influenza season is associated with increased cardiovascular hospitalizations, a decrease of ~\\u200950% in cardiovascular hospitalizations has been observed since the first diagnosed case of COVID-19, owing in part to deferred care. In the coming months, increasing efforts towards evaluating new interventions will be vital to curb COVID-19, especially as peak influenza season approaches. Currently, not enough data exist regarding co-infection of COVID-19 with influenza or how it would progress clinically, though it may cause a significant burden on an already struggling health care system. Until an effective COVID-19 vaccination is available, high coverage of influenza vaccination should be of utmost priority.', 'The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of severe COVID-19 patients was unknown. The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as the case fatality rate. Research information and following-up data were obtained from their medical records. The best cut-off value of NT-proBNP for predicting in-hospital death was 88.64\\u2009pg/mL with the sensitivity for 100% and the specificity for 66.67%. Patients with high NT-proBNP values (>\\u200988.64\\u2009pg/mL) had a significantly increased risk of death during the days of following-up compared with those with low values (≤88.64\\u2009pg/mL). After adjustment for potential risk factors, NT-proBNP was independently correlated with in-hospital death. NT-proBNP might be an independent risk factor for in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19. ClinicalTrials, NCT04292964. Registered 03 March 2020,', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is now a global pandemic with the highest number of affected individuals in the modern era. Not only is the infection inflicting significant morbidity and mortality, but there has also been\\xa0a significant strain to the health care system and the economy. COVID-19 typically presents as viral pneumonia, occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. However, emerging evidence suggests that it has a significant impact on the cardiovascular (CV) system by direct myocardial damage, severe systemic inflammatory response, hypoxia, right heart strain secondary to ARDS and lung injury, and plaque rupture secondary to inflammation. Primary cardiac manifestations include acute myocarditis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and abnormal clotting. Several consensus documents have been released to help manage CV disease during this pandemic. In this review, we summarize key cardiac manifestations, their management, and future implications.', 'The correlation between myocardial injury and clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients is gaining attention in the literature. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of cardiac involvement and of respiratory failure in a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in an academic hospital in Lombardy, one of the most affected Italian (and worldwide) regions by the epidemic. The study included 405 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a medical ward from February 25th to March 31st, 2020. Follow-up of surviving patients ended either at hospital discharge or by July 30th, 2020. Myocardial injury was defined on the basis of the presence of blood levels of hs-TnI above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Respiratory function was assessed as PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio. The primary end-point was death for any cause. During hospitalization, 124 patients died. Death rate increased from 7.9% in patients with normal hs-TnI plasma levels and no cardiac comorbidity to 61.5% in patients with elevated hs-TnI and cardiac involvement (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). At multivariable analysis, older age, P/F ratio\\u2009<\\u2009200 (both p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and hs-TnI plasma levels were independent predictors of death. However, it must be emphasized that the median values of hs-TnI were within normal range in non-survivors. Cardiac involvement at presentation was associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients, but, even in a population of COVID-19 patients who did not require invasive ventilation at hospital admission, mortality was mainly driven by older age and respiratory failure.', '', 'COVID-19 pandemic has currently no vaccines. Thus, the only feasible solution for prevention relies on the detection of COVID-19-positive cases through quick and accurate testing. Since artificial intelligence (AI) offers the powerful mechanism to automatically extract the tissue features and characterise the disease, we therefore hypothesise that AI-based strategies can provide quick detection and classification, especially for radiological computed tomography (CT) lung scans. Six models, two traditional machine learning (ML)-based (k-NN and RF), two transfer learning (TL)-based (VGG19 and InceptionV3), and the last two were our custom-designed deep learning (DL) models (CNN and iCNN), were developed for classification between COVID pneumonia (CoP) and non-COVID pneumonia (NCoP). K10 cross-validation (90% training: 10% testing) protocol on an Italian cohort of 100 CoP and 30 NCoP patients was used for performance evaluation and bispectrum analysis for CT lung characterisation. Using K10 protocol, our results showed the accuracy in the order of DL\\u2009>\\u2009TL\\u2009>\\u2009ML, ranging the six accuracies for k-NN, RF, VGG19, IV3, CNN, iCNN as 74.58\\u2009±\\u20092.44%, 96.84\\u2009±\\u20092.6, 94.84\\u2009±\\u20092.85%, 99.53\\u2009±\\u20090.75%, 99.53\\u2009±\\u20091.05%, and 99.69\\u2009±\\u20090.66%, respectively. The corresponding AUCs were 0.74, 0.94, 0.96, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99 (p-values\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), respectively. Our Bispectrum-based characterisation system suggested CoP can be separated against NCoP using AI models. COVID risk severity stratification also showed a high correlation of 0.7270 (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with clinical scores such as ground-glass opacities (GGO), further validating our AI models. We prove our hypothesis by demonstrating that all the six AI models successfully classified CoP against NCoP due to the strong presence of contrasting features such as ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, and pleural effusion in CoP patients. Further, our online system takes\\u2009<\\u20092\\xa0s for inference.', 'COVID-19 has caused great devastation in the past year. Multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) including lung ultrasound (LUS) and focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) as a clinical adjunct has played a significant role in triaging, diagnosis and medical management of COVID-19 patients. The expert panel from 27 countries and 6 continents with considerable experience of direct application of PoCUS on COVID-19 patients presents evidence-based consensus using GRADE methodology for the quality of evidence and an expedited, modified-Delphi process for the strength of expert consensus. The use of ultrasound is suggested in many clinical situations related to respiratory, cardiovascular and thromboembolic aspects of COVID-19, comparing well with other imaging modalities. The limitations due to insufficient data are highlighted as opportunities for future research.', '', 'The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with a starting point in China, has spread rapidly among people living in other countries and is approaching approximately 101,917,147 cases worldwide according to the statistics of World Health Organization. There are a limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the increasing cases daily. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people. In this study, five pre-trained convolutional neural network-based models (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia-infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. We have implemented three different binary classifications with four classes (COVID-19, normal (healthy), viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia) by using five-fold cross-validation. Considering the performance results obtained, it has been seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance (96.1% accuracy for Dataset-1, 99.5% accuracy for Dataset-2 and 99.7% accuracy for Dataset-3) among other four used models.', 'The new disease outbreak that causes atypical pneumonia named COVID-19, which started in China’s Wuhan province, has quickly spread to a pandemic. Although the imaging test of choice for the initial study is plain chest radiograph, CT has proven useful in characterizing better the complications associated with this new infection. We describe the evolution of 3 patients presenting pneumomediastinum and spontaneous pneumothorax as a very rare complication of COVID-19 and their particular interest as a probable prognostic factor.', 'The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began since early December 2019, and has been declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. Due to the hypercoagulable state, blood stasis and endothelial injury, severe patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for thrombosis. We report a case of very severe COVID-19 complicated with venous thrombosis and arteriosclerosis obliterans of lower extremities. Risk stratification for deep vein thrombosis and peripheral arterial disease are of vital importance for the prognosis of COVID-19.', 'In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, further understanding of its complications points towards dysregulated immune response as a major component. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also a disease of immune dysregulation leading to multisystem compromise. We present a case of new-onset SLE concomitantly with COVID-19 and development of antiphospholipid antibodies. An 18-year-old female that presented with hemodynamic collapse and respiratory failure, progressed to cardiac arrest, and had a pericardial tamponade drained. She then progressed to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, and worsening renal function with proteinuria and hematuria. Further studies showed bilateral pleural effusions, positive antinuclear and antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin B. C3 and C4 levels were low. SARS-Cov-2 PCR was positive after 2 negative tests. She also developed multiple deep venous thrombosis, in the setting of positive antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. In terms of pathophysiology, COVID-19 is believed to cause a dysregulated cytokine response which could potentially be exacerbated by the shift in Th1 to Th2 response seen in SLE. Also, it is well documented that viral infections are an environmental factor that contributes to the development of autoimmunity; however, COVID-19 is a new entity, and it is not known if it could trigger autoimmune conditions. Additionally, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2, as it happens with other viruses, might lead to the formation of antiphospholipid antibodies, potentially contributing to the increased rates of thrombosis seen in COVID-19.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 100,000 deaths in the USA. Our institution has treated over 2000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics including the persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67\\u2009years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-White. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (24%), and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (> 70\\u2009years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p < 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-White race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32\\u2009days after initial diagnosis. The median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19–68) days from initial positive PCR. Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia was associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to the identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcomes in future outbreaks of COVID-19.', '', 'Iron metabolism and anemia may play an important role in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate biomarkers of anemia and iron metabolism (hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, haptoglobin, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, erythropoietin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrine, and erythrocyte indices) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and explored their prognostic value. Six bibliographic databases were searched up to August 3rd 2020. We included 189 unique studies, with data from 57,563 COVID-19 patients. Pooled mean hemoglobin and ferritin levels in COVID-19 patients across all ages were 129.7\\xa0g/L (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 128.51; 130.88) and 777.33\\xa0ng/mL (95% CI, 701.33; 852.77), respectively. Hemoglobin levels were lower with older age, higher percentage of subjects with diabetes, hypertension and overall comorbidities, and admitted to intensive care. Ferritin level increased with older age, increasing proportion of hypertensive study participants, and increasing proportion of mortality. Compared to moderate cases, severe COVID-19 cases had lower hemoglobin [weighted mean difference (WMD),\\u2009−\\u20094.08\\xa0g/L (95% CI\\u2009−\\u20095.12;\\u2009−\\u20093.05)] and red blood cell count [WMD,\\u2009−\\u20090.16\\u2009×\\u20091012 /L\\xa0(95% CI\\u2009−\\u20090.31;\\u2009−\\u20090.014)], and higher ferritin [WMD,\\u2009−\\u2009473.25\\xa0ng/mL (95% CI 382.52; 563.98)] and red cell distribution width [WMD, 1.82% (95% CI 0.10; 3.55)]. A significant difference in mean ferritin levels of 606.37\\xa0ng/mL (95% CI 461.86; 750.88) was found between survivors and non-survivors, but not in hemoglobin levels. Future studies should explore the impact of iron metabolism and anemia in the pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19.', 'During the COVID-19 2020 outbreak, a large body of data has been provided on general management and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Yet, relatively little is known on characteristics and outcome of patients managed\\xa0in Internal Medicine Units (IMU). To address this gap, the Italian Society of Internal Medicine has conducted a nationwide cohort multicentre study on death outcome in adult COVID-19 patients admitted and managed in IMU. This study assessed 3044 COVID-19 patients at 41 referral hospitals across Italy from February 3rd to May 8th 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, organ dysfunction, treatment, and outcomes including death were assessed. During the study period, 697 patients (22.9%) were transferred to intensive care units, and 351 died in IMU (death rate 14.9%). At admission, factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality were age (OR 2.46, p\\u2009=\\u20090.000), productive cough (OR 2.04, p\\u2009=\\u20090.000), pre-existing chronic heart failure (OR 1.58, p\\u2009=\\u20090.017) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.17, p\\u2009=\\u20090.048), the number of comorbidities (OR 1.34, p\\u2009=\\u20090.000) and polypharmacy (OR 1.20, p\\u2009=\\u20090.000). Of note, up to 40% of elderly patients did not report fever at admission. Decreasing PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission was strongly inversely associated with survival. The use of conventional oxygen supplementation increased with the number of pre-existing comorbidities, but it did not associate with better survival in patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio\\u2009<\\u2009100. The latter, significantly benefited by the early use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Our study identified PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission and comorbidity as the main alert signs to inform clinical decisions and resource allocation in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to IMU.', 'Cardiac arrhythmias are known complications in patients with COVID-19 infection that may persist even after recovery from infection. A review of the spectrum of cardiac arrhythmias due to COVID-19 infection and current guidelines and assessment or risk and benefit of management considerations is necessary as the population of patients infected and covering from COVID-19 continues to grow. Cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, complete heart block, and ventricular tachycardia occur in patients infected, recovering and recovered from COVID-19. Personalized care while balancing risk/benefit of medical or invasive therapy is necessary to improve care of patients with arrhythmias. Providers must provide thorough follow-up care and use necessary precaution while caring for COVID-19 patients.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the pandemic of the new millennium. COVID-19 can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, potentially determining multi-organ dysfunction. Data on the relationship between COVID-19 and thyroid have been emerging, and rapidly increasing since March 2020. The thyroid gland and the virus infection with its associated inflammatory-immune responses are known to be engaged in complex interplay. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 combined with the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as the key molecular complex to infect the host cells. Interestingly, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels are high in the thyroid gland and more than in the lungs. Our literature search provided greater evidence that the thyroid gland and the entire hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis could be relevant targets of damage by SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, COVID-19-related thyroid disorders include thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, as well as nonthyroidal illness syndrome. Moreover, we noticed that treatment plans for thyroid cancer are considerably changing in the direction of more teleconsultations and less diagnostic and therapeutical procedures. The current review includes findings that could be changed soon by new results on the topic, considering the rapidity of worldwide research on COVID-19.', 'The reliable and rapid identification of the COVID-19 has become crucial to prevent the rapid spread of the disease, ease lockdown restrictions and reduce pressure on public health infrastructures. Recently, several methods and techniques have been proposed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus using different images and data. However, this is the first study that will explore the possibility of using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to detect COVID-19 from electrocardiogram (ECG) trace images. In this work, COVID-19 and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were detected using deep-learning techniques. A public dataset of ECG images consisting of 1937 images from five distinct categories, such as normal, COVID-19, myocardial infarction (MI), abnormal heartbeat (AHB), and recovered myocardial infarction (RMI) were used in this study. Six different deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2) were used to investigate three different classification schemes: (i) two-class classification (normal vs COVID-19); (ii) three-class classification (normal, COVID-19, and other CVDs), and finally, (iii) five-class classification (normal, COVID-19, MI, AHB, and RMI). For two-class and three-class classification, Densenet201 outperforms other networks with an accuracy of 99.1%, and 97.36%, respectively; while for the five-class classification, InceptionV3 outperforms others with an accuracy of 97.83%. ScoreCAM visualization confirms that the networks are learning from the relevant area of the trace images. Since the proposed method uses ECG trace images which can be captured by smartphones and are readily available facilities in low-resources countries, this study will help in faster computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 and other cardiac abnormalities.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is presenting as a systemic disease associated with vascular inflammation and endothelial injury. Severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and there is still an ongoing debate on whether COVID-19 ARDS and its perfusion defect differs from ARDS induced by other causes. Beside pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1 β [IL-1β] or IL-6), several main pathological phenomena have been seen because of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction: hypercoagulation reflected by fibrin degradation products called D-dimers, micro- and macrothrombosis and pathological angiogenesis. Direct endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to occur and ACE-2 expression by EC is a matter of debate. Indeed, endothelial damage reported in severely ill patients with COVID-19 could be more likely secondary to infection of neighboring cells and/or a consequence of inflammation. Endotheliopathy could give rise to hypercoagulation by alteration in the levels of different factors such as von Willebrand factor. Other than thrombotic events, pathological angiogenesis is among the recent findings. Overexpression of different proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) or placental growth factors (PlGF) have been found in plasma or lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an emergency myelopoiesis associated to deregulated immunity and mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells, leading to features of acquired hematological malignancies or cardiovascular disease, which are discussed in this review. Altogether, this review will try to elucidate the pathophysiology of thrombotic complications, pathological angiogenesis and EC dysfunction, allowing better insight in new targets and antithrombotic protocols to better address vascular system dysfunction. Since treating SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential long-term effects involves targeting the vascular compartment and/or mobilization of immature immune cells, we propose to define COVID-19 and its complications as a systemic vascular acquired hemopathy.', 'The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.\\n We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.\\n The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.\\n The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.\\n', 'In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in the throat swab sample of one patient. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, COVID-19 has spread widely around the world, affecting more than seventy countries. China, with a huge burden of this disease, has taken strong measures to control the spread and improve the curative rate of COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. A comprehensive understanding will help to control the disease.', 'As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, payers across the USA have stepped up to alleviate patients’ financial burden by waiving cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment. However, there has been no substantive discussion of potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on patient health or their financial and policy implications. After recovery, patients remain at risk for lung disease, heart disease, frailty, and mental health disorders. There may also be long-term sequelae of adverse events that develop in the course of COVID-19 and its treatment. These complications are likely to place additional medical, psychological, and economic burdens on all patients, with lower-income individuals, the uninsured and underinsured, and individuals experiencing homelessness being most vulnerable. Thus, there needs to be a comprehensive plan for preventing and managing post-COVID-19 complications to quell their clinical, economic, and public health consequences and to support patients experiencing delayed morbidity and disability as a result.', '', 'The COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary global emergency that has led to the implementation of unprecedented measures in order to stem the spread of the infection. Internationally, governments are enforcing measures such as travel bans, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing leading to an extended period of time at home. This has resulted in reductions in physical activity and changes in dietary intakes that have the potential to accelerate sarcopenia, a deterioration of muscle mass and function (more likely in older populations), as well as increases in body fat. These changes in body composition are associated with a number of chronic, lifestyle diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, osteoporosis, frailty, cognitive decline, and depression. Furthermore, CVD, diabetes, and elevated body fat are associated with greater risk of COVID-19 infection and more severe symptomology, underscoring the importance of avoiding the development of such morbidities. Here we review mechanisms of sarcopenia and their relation to the current data on the effects of COVID-19 confinement on physical activity, dietary habits, sleep, and stress as well as extended bed rest due to COVID-19 hospitalization. The potential of these factors to lead to an increased likelihood of muscle loss and chronic disease will be discussed. By offering a number of home-based strategies including resistance exercise, higher protein intakes and supplementation, we can potentially guide public health authorities to avoid a lifestyle disease and rehabilitation crisis post-COVID-19. Such strategies may also serve as useful preventative measures for reducing the likelihood of sarcopenia in general and in the event of future periods of isolation.', 'The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on containing SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying treatment strategies. While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decrease\\xa0and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the\\xa0private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.', 'The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raging across the world. The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.', 'COVID-19 is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus that is moving so rapidly that on 30 January 2020 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on 11 March 2020 as a pandemic. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for disease treatment and control of the disease spread. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated a low sensibility; therefore chest computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role not only in the early detection and diagnosis, especially for false negative RT-PCR tests, but also in monitoring the clinical course and in evaluating the disease severity. This paper reports the CT findings with some hints on the temporal changes over the course of the disease: the CT hallmarks of COVID-19 are bilateral distribution of ground glass opacities with or without consolidation in the posterior and peripheral lung, but the predominant findings in later phases include consolidations, linear opacities, “crazy-paving” pattern, “reversed halo” sign and vascular enlargement. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of other diseases, in particular the viral pneumonia including influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, etc. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The aim of this article is to review the typical and atypical CT findings in COVID-19 patients in order to help radiologists and clinicians to become more familiar with the disease.', 'To describe clinical characteristics of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and immunosuppressive therapies with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at an academic rheumatology center in Madrid and to identify baseline variables associated with a severe infection requiring hospitalization. We identified SARS-CoV-2 positive cases by polymerase chain reaction performed at our center within an updated RMDs database in our clinic. Additional RMDs patients were identified when they contacted the clinic because of a positive infection. Data extraction included diagnosis, demographics, immunosuppressive treatment, comorbidities, and laboratory tests. Comparisons between patients with or without hospitalization were performed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze associations between baseline variables and need for hospitalization. A total of 62 patients with COVID-19 and underlying RMDs were identified by April 24, 2020. Median age was 60.9\\xa0years, and 42% men. Forty-two patients required hospitalization; these were more frequently men, older and with comorbidities. There were no statistically significant between-group differences for rheumatologic diagnosis and for baseline use of immunosuppressive therapy except for glucocorticoids that were more frequent in hospitalized patients. Total deaths were 10 (16%) patients. In multivariate analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 8.63; p\\u2009=\\u20090.018), previous lung disease (OR, 27.47; p\\u2009=\\u20090.042), and glucocorticoids use (>\\u20095\\xa0mg/day) (OR, 9.95; p\\u2009=\\u20090.019) were significantly associated to hospitalization. Neither specific RMD diagnoses or exposures to DMARDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalization. Being male, previous lung disease and exposure to glucocorticoids were associated with higher odds of hospitalization in RMDs patients.', '', '', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. In the USA, the burden of mortality and morbidity has fallen on minority populations. The understanding of the impact of this pandemic has been limited in Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs), though disaggregated data suggest disproportionately high mortality rates. AAPIs are at high risk for COVID-19 transmission, in part due to their over-representation in the essential workforce, but also due to cultural factors, such as intergenerational residency, and other social determinants of health, including poverty and lack of health insurance. Some AAPI subgroups also report a high comorbidity burden, which may increase their susceptibility to more severe COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, AAPIs have encountered rising xenophobia and racism across the country, and we fear such discrimination only serves to exacerbate these rapidly emerging disparities in this community. We recommend interventions including disaggregation of mortality and morbidity data, investment in community-based healthcare, advocacy against discrimination and the use of non-inflammatory language, and a continued emphasis on underlying comorbidities, to ensure the protection of vulnerable communities and the navigation of this current crisis.', 'Data from large patient registry studies suggested an increased incidence and increased mortality in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This study aimed to compare the prevalence of OSA in patients with and without COVID-19 among patients admitted to the same hospital in the same time period. In addition, the impact of OSA on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infection was investigated. Observational cohort study. Clinical data were collected retrospectively from the complete medical records for each patient individually from March 1st 2020 to May 16th 2020. A total of 723 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 1161 with non-COVID-19 disease. The prevalence of OSA did not differ between these groups (n\\u2009=\\u200949; 6.8% versus n\\u2009=\\u200966; 5.7%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.230). In patients with COVID-19, mortality was increased in the group of 49 patients with OSA (n\\u2009=\\u200917; 34.7%) compared to 674 COVID-19 patients without OSA (n\\u2009=\\u2009143; 21.2%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.028). This increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients with OSA (OR\\u2009=\\u20092.590; 95%CI 1.218–5.507) was independent from Body Mass Index (BMI), male gender, age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive lung disease. Presence of OSA in COVID-19 disease was further associated with an increased length of hospital stay (12.6\\u2009±\\u200915.7\\xa0days versus 9.6\\u2009±\\u20099.9\\xa0days; p\\u2009=\\u20090.049). The prevalence of OSA did not differ between patients with or without COVID-19, but mortality and hospital length of stay were increased in patients with\\xa0OSA and comorbid COVID-19. Hence, OSA should be included in COVID-19 risk factor analyses, Clinicians should be aware of the association and the mechanism should be further explored.', 'In the early February, 2020, we called up an experts’ committee with more than 30 Chinese experts from 11 national medical academic organizations to formulate the first edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children, which has been published in this journal. With accumulated experiences in the\\xa0diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, we have updated the consensus statement and released the second edition recently. The current version in English is a condensed version of the second edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in children.\\xa0In the current version,\\xa0diagnosis and treatement criteria have been optimized, and early identification of severe and critical cases is highlighted. The early warning indicators for severe pediatric\\xa0cases have been summarized which is utmost important for clinical practice. This version of experts consensus will be valuable for better prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children worldwide.\\xa0\\xa0', 'Pediatric coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection is relatively mild when compared to adults, and children are reported to have a better prognosis. Mortality in children appears rare. Clinical features of COVID-19 in children include fever and cough, but a large proportion of infected children appears to be asymptomatic and may contribute to transmission. It remains unclear why children and young adults are less severely affected than older individuals, but this might involve differences in immune system function in the elderly and/or differences in the expression/function of the cellular receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)- Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Laboratory findings and chest imaging may not be specific in children with COVID-19. Diagnosis is by Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of upper or lower respiratory tract secretions. This review additionally considers COVID-19 in immunosuppressed children, and also suggests a management algorithm for the few children who appear to present with life threatening infection, including the potential use of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment. The most significant threat to global child health from SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be related to COVID 19 in children, but rather the socio-economic consequences of a prolonged pandemic.', 'Corona virus outbreak started in December 2019, and the disease has been defined by the World Health Organization as a public health emergency. Coronavirus is a source of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) due to complications such as over-coagulation, blood stasis, and endothelial damage. In this study, we report a 26-year-old pregnant woman with coronavirus who was hospitalized with a right ovarian vein thrombosis at Besat Hospital in Sanandaj. Risk classification for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) disease is of crucial importance for the forecast of coronavirus.', 'COVID-19 mortality studies have primarily focused on persons aged ≥ 65 years; less is known about decedents aged <65 years. We conducted a case-control study among NYC residents aged 21–64 years hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosed March 13–April 9, 2020, to determine risk factors for death. Case-patients (n=343) were hospitalized decedents with COVID-19 and control-patients (n=686) were discharged from hospitalization with COVID-19 and matched 2:1 to case-patients on age and residential neighborhood. Conditional logistic regression models were adjusted for patient sex, insurance status, and marital status. Matched adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated for selected underlying conditions, combinations of conditions, and race/ethnic group. Median age of both case-patients and control-patients was 56 years (range: 23–64 years). Having ≥ 1 selected underlying condition increased odds of death 4.45-fold (95% CI: 2.33–8.49). Patients with diabetes; morbid obesity; heart, kidney, or lung disease; cancer; neurologic/neurodevelopmental conditions; mental health conditions; or HIV had significantly increased odds of death. Compared with having neither condition, having both diabetes and obesity or diabetes and heart disease was associated with approximately threefold odds of death. Five select underlying conditions were more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black control-patients than among control-patients of other races/ethnicities. Selected underlying conditions were risk factors for death, and most prevalent among racial/ethnic minorities. Social services; health care resources, including vaccination; and tailored public health messaging are important for COVID-19 prevention. Strengthening these strategies for racial/ethnic minority groups could minimize COVID-19 racial/ethnic disparities.', 'The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic has swept all over the world, posing a great pressure on critical care resources due to large number of patients needing critical care. Statements from front-line experts in the field of intensive care are urgently needed. Sixteen front-line experts in China fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan were organized to develop an expert statement after 5 rounds of expert seminars and discussions to provide trustworthy recommendation on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Each expert was assigned tasks within their field of expertise to provide draft statements and rationale. Parts of the expert statement are based on epidemiological and clinical evidence, without available scientific evidences. A comprehensive document with 46 statements are presented, including protection of medical personnel, etiological treatment, diagnosis and treatment of tissue and organ functional impairment, psychological interventions, immunity therapy, nutritional support, and transportation of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Among them, 5 recommendations were strong (Grade 1), 21 were weak (Grade 2), and 20 were experts’ opinions. A strong agreement from voting participants was obtained for all recommendations. There are still no targeted therapies for COVID-19 patients. Dynamic monitoring and supportive treatment for the restoration of tissue vascularization and organ function are particularly important.']\n",

The incidence is 9%–17% based on various studies, although the exact incidence is thought to be higher. The incidence is increasing with the availability of improved imaging techniques which aid early diagnosis, and effective systemic treatment regimens which prolong life, thus allowing cancer to disseminate to the brain. Lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma are the most frequent to develop brain metastases, and account for 67%–80% of all cancers. Most patients with brain metastases have synchronous extracerebral metastases. Some patients present with no known primary cancer diagnosis. In children, brain metastases are rare; germ cell tumors, sarcomas, and neuroblastoma are the common offenders.\",\"datePublished\":\"2011-10-20\",\"dateModified\":\"2011-10-20\",\"pageStart\":\"48\",\"pageEnd\":\"54\",\"sameAs\":\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11912-011-0203-y\",\"keywords\":\"Oncology\",\"image\":\"\",\"isPartOf\":{\"name\":\"Current Oncology Reports\",\"issn\":[\"1534-6269\",\"1523-3790\"],\"volumeNumber\":\"14\",\"@type\":[\"Periodical\",\"PublicationVolume\"]},\"publisher\":{\"name\":\"Current Science Inc.\",\"logo\":{\"url\":\"https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png\",\"@type\":\"ImageObject\"},\"@type\":\"Organization\"},\"author\":[{\"name\":\"Nayak, Lakshmi\",\"affiliation\":[{\"name\":\"Division of Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital\",\"address\":{\"name\":\"Center for Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center, Division of Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, USA\",\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\"},\"@type\":\"Organization\"}],\"@type\":\"Person\"},{\"name\":\"Lee, Eudocia Quant\",\"affiliation\":[{\"name\":\"Division of Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital\",\"address\":{\"name\":\"Center for Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center, Division of Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, USA\",\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\"},\"@type\":\"Organization\"}],\"@type\":\"Person\"},{\"name\":\"Wen, Patrick Y.\",\"affiliation\":[{\"name\":\"Division of Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital\",\"address\":{\"name\":\"Center for Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center, Division of Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, USA\",\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\"},\"@type\":\"Organization\"}],\"email\":\"Patrick_Wen@dfci.harvard.edu\",\"@type\":\"Person\"}],\"isAccessibleForFree\":false,\"hasPart\":{\"isAccessibleForFree\":false,\"cssSelector\":\".main-content\",\"@type\":\"WebPageElement\"},\"@type\":\"ScholarlyArticle\"},\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"WebPage\"}</script>\n",

The incidence is 9%–17% based on various studies, although the exact incidence is thought to be higher. The incidence is increasing with the availability of improved imaging techniques which aid early diagnosis, and effective systemic treatment regimens which prolong life, thus allowing cancer to disseminate to the brain. Lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma are the most frequent to develop brain metastases, and account for 67%–80% of all cancers. Most patients with brain metastases have synchronous extracerebral metastases. Some patients present with no known primary cancer diagnosis. In children, brain metastases are rare; germ cell tumors, sarcomas, and neuroblastoma are the common offenders.</p></div></div></section>\n",
