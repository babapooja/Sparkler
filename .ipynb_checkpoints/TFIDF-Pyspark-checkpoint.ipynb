intended to summarize and compare the methods of automatic detection of brain tumor through magnetic resonance image mri used in different stages of computer aided detection system cad brain image classification techniques are studied existing methods are classically divided into region based and contour based methods these are usually dedicated to full enhanced tumors or specific types of tumors the amount of resources required to describe large set of data is simplified and selected in for tissue segmentation in this paper modified image segmentation techniques were applied on mri scan images in order to detect brain tumors also in this paper a modified probabilistic neural network pnn mode l that is based on learning vector quantization lvq with image and data analysis and manipulation techniques is proposed to carry out an automated brain tumor classification using mri scans the assessment of the modified pnn classifier performance is me asured in terms of the training performance classification accuracies and computational time the simulation results showed that the modified pnn gives rapid and accurate classification compared with the image processing and published conventional pnn techniques simulation results also showed that the proposed system out performs the corresponding pnn system presented and successfully handle the process of brain tumor classification in mri image with accurac y index terms magnetic resonance image mri comput er aided detection system cad probabilistic neural network pnn edge detection', 'we present the design and

computational electromagnetics we explain why it is relatively easy to arrive at fast algorithms for static problems but harder for wave physics problems second the understanding of wave physics is very important in classical electromagnetics but its understanding also allows us to understand other physical phenomena requiring wave physics such as transport of electrons in complex structures
